# Edges can have three different input features: distance (related to the length of the edge),
# bond-angle, which is a sum of cosines of bond angles (note that this particular feature
# is in general different for each of the two edges that define a bond, as the angles are 
# defined between the neighbours of i in the first edge, and between the neighbours of j
# in the second edge), and finally dihedral features, which are a sum of cosines of dihedral
# angles in which i-j is the central bond (contrary to bond-angle, this feature is the same
# for both edges in the bond

# bond angle features

BondAngleFeatures: True

# optionally, edges can also have dihedral features, i.e. a sum of cosines of the dihedral angles
# in which the edge participates as the central edge. A dihedral angle in a sequence of three
# consecutive edges, 1-2-3-4 is the cosine of the angle between planes 1-2-3 and 2-3-4, and is
# assigned to edge 2-3.
